"""Source-level pin: cabinet ``/purchase-tariff`` must resolve an EXPIRED
trial of the SAME tariff when renewing, so it converts the trial in place
(same Remnawave user/link) instead of spawning a new subscription + new link.

Background — the bug this defends against
-----------------------------------------
Prod report (2026-06): a user whose 3-day trial has EXPIRED renews the same
("Базовый") tariff via the cabinet. ``purchase_tariff`` resolved the existing
subscription via ``get_subscription_by_user_and_tariff(user, tariff)`` WITHOUT
``include_inactive`` → that lookup only matches ACTIVE/TRIAL/LIMITED, so the
expired trial (``status='expired'``) was invisible → the trial got killed by
``deactivate_user_trial_subscriptions`` and a fresh ``create_paid_subscription``
ran → a NEW Remnawave user + NEW subscription link → the user has to re-add all
devices. 7 affected users on prod.

Fix shape
---------
Pass ``include_inactive=True`` to the tariff-level lookup so an EXPIRED (or
disabled) same-tariff subscription is found. It then flows into the existing
extend-in-place branch (``extend_subscription`` clears the trial flag) and
``update_remnawave_user`` (the row already carries ``remnawave_id``) → SAME
link. Picking a DIFFERENT tariff still returns ``None`` for that tariff → a new
subscription, which is the intended "same-tariff only" semantic.

A full integration test would need a real DB + FastAPI deps; this pins the
SOURCE-LEVEL contract — the bug class ("drop include_inactive") is grep-detectable.
